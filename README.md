# Termination-Board-PCBs
This repository contains KiCad PCB designs created by me for the ATLAS ITk Pixel Type-1 Services. These boards will carry high voltage sensor bias, low voltage high current module power, and module communication signals into the ATLAS detector for the Pixel modules.

Termination Boards v1 and v2 are preliminary designs which were used for testing and are now outdated.

Termination Board v3 is the design used for the 19-x prototypes.

Termination Board DCS v2 is an updated version of only the DCS board from the term board v3. This board was used for DCS supply on the 19-x Coupled Ring prototype PP0. It accounts for changes of the PP0 for only the 19-x prototypes, and is not part of the final design termination boards.

Termination Board v4 includes updated designs to the termination boards to reorrient the Type-1 services landing pads by 45 degrees. This will ease strain on the attached cables and their solder joints compared to an abrupt 90 degree bend.

19-x Cable Mapping directory contains schematics for the Type-1 service cable bundle wiring for the 19-x prototypes. These include prototypes of a Coupled Ring and an L0+2L1 Barrel. These differ from the final design in that the PP1 connectors used are banana jacks, SHV plugs, and DB25 connectors and the L0+2L1 PP0 is divided into 3 seperate PP0's for ease of prototyping and data breakout.
